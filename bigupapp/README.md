### Project Description
- Design
   The design of the application can be found Here: https://www.figma.com/file/wadC89Pj6fm6VRDLxPpJbz/UI?type=design&mode=design&t=VtjX0cfUtR4Dnq9U-0. Each team member is expected to replicate the design of their assigned screen as closely as possible(But feel free to change the app theme if you want).

- Implementation
   Each team member will be responsible for both the design and the logic of their assigned screen. This includes creating the UI in Flutter and implementing any necessary functionality.

- Collaboration
   All work will be done collaboratively using GitHub. Each team member will create their own branch for their screen and will merge their changes into the main branch upon completion.
